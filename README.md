## A Multi-Robot GSPN Software Framework to Execute and Visualize Plans
This package was developed in the scope of my Master's Thesis in Instituto Superior TÃ©cnico. The package includes two different implementations, diferentiated by the technologies that are supported. Inside the "common" folder, you will find the standalone version of our framework where you can use a GSPN tool to execute and visualize plans in a system with agents. Inside the "ros" folder, you will find the ROS implementation of our framework where you can use a GSPN tol to execute and visualize plans in a system with robots.

<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Product Name Screen Shot][product-screenshot]](https://example.com)

This package extended the package created on https://github.com/cazevedo/gspn-framework by adding two new modules: the execution module and the visualization module. The architecture is briefly presented in . And more specifically in .

### Built With
This framework was generally built with concurrent futures, Vis.js, sparse, numpy, flask and json. 
* [Concurrent futures](https://docs.python.org/3/library/concurrent.futures.html#module-concurrent.futures)
* [Vis.js](https://visjs.org/)
* [Sparse](https://pypi.org/project/sparse/)
* [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
* [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/)
* [Json](https://www.json.org/json-en.html)

The ROS implementation was built with:



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started

This is an example of how you may give instructions on setting up your project locally.
To get a local copy up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

This is an example of how to list things you need to use the software and how to install them.
* npm
```sh
npm install npm@latest -g
```

### Installation

1. Get a free API Key at [https://example.com](https://example.com)
2. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/your_username_/Project-Name.git
```
3. Install NPM packages
```sh
npm install
```
4. Enter your API in `config.js`
```JS
const API_KEY = 'ENTER YOUR API';
```



<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Standalone version usage 
In order to run the standalone version of the full package, all you need to do is run the following command inside gspn_framework_package/common/src/gspn_framework_package/:
```sh
python3 gspn_visualization.py
```
Afterwards, choose one of the example GSPNs and play around with the user interface. You do not need to run the execution module as well because the visualization module is connected with the execution module. 

However, if you only want to run the execution module, you must run the following command inside gspn_framework_package/common/src/gspn_framework_package/:
```sh
python3 gspn_execution.py
```

On this case, you will be queried about the whereabouts of the input file.
